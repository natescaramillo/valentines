                Are you G? That moment started a story I want to never end, day by day 
                I get to know you bit by bit on a deeper level, a deeper connection. 
                No other woman I want to spend my lifetime with, no other woman but You, 
                I may not be the richest, the smartest, the strongest, the most handsome 
                looking of all, but rest assured that I am a working in progress to be
                the Man to prove his worth to a fine lady like you babyyy.
                You still look perfect as the days go by, even on our 
                tiring ones you make me smile. I cannot count
                how many times I have told myself how lucky I am to understand you on 
                a deeper connection that no other man would be. This Valentines marks the
                first of many valentines to come and I want to spend it all with you. To
                spend all the days God allows me on Earth with you. 
                Congratulations babyyyyy for overcoming
                this Preliminary exam of the 2nd semester A.Y 2026.
                You have surpassed all expectations and did 
                your very best even if you are not feeling the best in health.
                I'm so proud and lucky to be your number wan supporter always.
        <br /> <br />To my Cheescake. Happy Valentines Day
